                <p style="text-indent: 20px">Originally from O'Fallon, Missouri, I moved to Austin in 2006 to attend the University of Texas where I studied
                    biochemistry. I have since worked in organic chemistry and most recently dental insurance. I am now looking
                    forward to a career change into the field of technology which is why I decided to enroll in the UT coding
                    bootcamp.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-indent: 20px"> My interests include film, hiking and music. Most of all, I am a huge fan of DOGS! I have two chihuahua daughters
                    named Rubita and Gypsy Witch and I love them more than anything in the world :).</p>
